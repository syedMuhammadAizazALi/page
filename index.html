      <p>When applying for his job at Huawei, Adiv was interviewed by Dr. Roni El-Bahar, a Technion graduate and head of the company's analog division. "Because Dr. El-Bahar is a Technion graduate, he wanted to recruit students from the Technion only, and interviewed them for this position. In addition, several students from Bar Ilan were invited for interviews, and I was one of them. Following the interviews, he concluded that the students from Bar-Ilan were at a much higher level. Today, we are a team of five students, all from Bar-Ilan. Dr. El-Bahar also met Professor Yossi Shor at a professional conference and complimented him on the Faculty's high level of students in the field of analog design."</p>
